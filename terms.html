            <h4>1.Terms</h4>
            <p>By accessing KODEX, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms,
                you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this website are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>
            <h4>2.Use of license</h4>
            <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on KODEX for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license
                you may not:
                <ol>
                    <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
                    <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
                    <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on KODEX</li>
                    <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
                    <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by KODEX at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any
                downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</p>
            <h4>3.Limitations</h4>
            <p>In no event shall KODEX or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on KODEX, even
                if KODEX or a KODEX authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential
                or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
            <h4>4. Accuracy of materials</h4>
            <p>The materials appearing on KODEX could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. KODEX does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. KODEX may make changes to the materials contained
                on its website at any time without notice. However KODEX does not make any commitment to update the materials.</p>
            <h4>5.Links</h4>
            <p>KODEX has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by KODEX of the site. Use of any such linked website is at
                the user's own risk.</p>
